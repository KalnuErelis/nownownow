# What I'm doing now

*Last updated: August 20, 2025 (from Lithuania)*

## Current Focus

Right now I'm focused on building my personal web presence and learning new technologies. This includes:

- **Building** this personal "now" page following Derek Sivers' philosophy
- **Learning** modern web development and automation tools
- **Exploring** how to integrate Obsidian with web publishing workflows
- **Setting up** a sustainable system for regular updates

## Recent Changes

Just launched this "now" page! Moving away from scattered social media updates toward a more intentional way of sharing what I'm actually working on. 

## Location & Context

Based in Lithuania, currently in an exploration phase of personal website development and finding better ways to document and share my journey.
