# What I'm doing now

*Last updated: August 20, 2025 (from Lithuania)

## Current Focus

Right now I'm focused on building my personal web presence and learning new technologies. This includes:

- Building small apps with ClaudeCode at WhiteBridge.ai
- Preparing for 104k Trail Run in October.
- Living between Vilnius and Vienna.

## Recent Changes

Just launched this "now" page! Moving away from scattered social media updates toward a more intentional way of sharing what I'm actually working on. 

## Location & Context

Based in Lithuania, currently in an exploration phase of personal website development and finding better ways to document and share my journey.
